In the context of contemporary social platforms, a prevalent concern revolves around offensive and hurtful comments.
To address and understand these issues, this project aims to employ machine learning techniques for the identification and evaluation of comment toxicity. 
The categorization is delineated into five sections, providing insights into the levels of toxicity within sentences. 
Leveraging neural networks and TensorFlow, the project utilizes straightforward text vectorization techniques and a streamlined pipeline to assess comment toxicity based on input data.
